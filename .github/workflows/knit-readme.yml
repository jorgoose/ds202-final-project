Speeding up a GitHub Actions workflow that includes R and pandoc can be challenging due to the computational nature of R and the time required to install dependencies and knit documents. However, here are some strategies that can help reduce the runtime:

Cache Pandoc Installation: If the pandoc version available in the GitHub Actions runner is suitable for your needs, you might not need to install it each time. If you do need a specific version of pandoc, consider caching the installation just like you do with R packages.

Bundle Package Installation: Instead of checking and installing each package separately, you can create a script that installs all necessary packages at once. This will reduce the overhead of starting R multiple times.

Use TinyTeX: If you are using LaTeX to knit PDFs, consider using TinyTeX, a lightweight, portable, cross-platform, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live. rmarkdown can automatically install missing LaTeX packages when knitting R Markdown documents to PDF.

Optimize R Markdown: Ensure that any large datasets or long-running analyses are precomputed if possible and saved as R data objects that can be loaded quickly. If the analysis must be dynamic, consider if it can be simplified or if you can use caching within the R Markdown document itself with the cache = TRUE chunk option.

Parallel Chunk Execution: If you have multiple independent chunks that are time-consuming, consider using the future package to run them in parallel, assuming the GitHub Actions runner provides multiple cores.

Use a Docker Container: Set up a Docker container that has all the necessary system dependencies pre-installed. This can include R, pandoc, LaTeX, and all R packages. Your GitHub Action can use this container as the environment, which can save time spent on setup.

Remove Unnecessary Files: After knitting, remove any unnecessary files before committing to Git to prevent the repository from becoming bloated over time.

Here is an optimized version of your workflow incorporating some of these suggestions:
